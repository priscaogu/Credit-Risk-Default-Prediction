## Title: Optimizing Credit Risk Assessment for Financial Institutions

## Business problem

## Objective:
Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the Probability of Default (PD) for loan applicants. These models will use application data (e.g., income, loan amount, previous defaults) and behavioral data (e.g., payment history, credit utilization) to provide a reliable PD estimate. The solution aims to enhance the credit risk assessment process, allowing financial institutions to make data-driven decisions and optimize their loan portfolios.

## Problem Statement:
Financial institutions need a reliable and efficient method to calculate the Probability of Default (PD) for loan applicants. This metric helps in evaluating the credit risk associated with each applicant and making informed decisions. The challenge lies in accurately predicting PD using diverse data sources, such as application data and behavioral data, and integrating this prediction into the decision-making process to reduce the risk of default while maximizing profitability.


## Steps to Successs

•	Data Cleaning: Ensured data consistency by handling missing values and outliers.

•	Feature Selection and Feature Engineering: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using ordinal encoding and one-hot encoding. Utilized ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, and correlation matrices to assess the relationships between predictor variables and the target variable.

•	Model Building & Validation: Trained predictive models using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting methods to classify loan defaults. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as F1 Score, Accuracy, ROC Curve, and Calibration Curve to ensure robust and reliable predictions. Achieved an accuracy rate of 0.90 and 0.94 respectively.

•	Reporting: Developed a strategy table to assess model thresholds, providing insights into acceptance rates, bad rates, estimated values, and the number of accepted loans at various cutoff points
